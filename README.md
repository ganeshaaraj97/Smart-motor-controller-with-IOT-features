Agriculture is the key component of the economy for the countries like Sri Lanka. Identifying
the problems in the traditional agriculture and trying to solve them with the help of
technology will lead to yield a lot of crops. Here we have identified an agriculture problem
and we have developed a system to overcome the some identified problems in agriculture.

In traditional system, what the farmers do is, they observe their farming land and based on
their previous experiences, they decide to water the crops. Farmers need to be in the land to
switch on and off the motor. This procedure has following disadvantages

 1.Possibility for inefficient management in a vast field area

 2.Farmers should always physically present near the field /no remote access

 3.Inexperienced farmers will struggle to make decisions on watering the crops.

Our systems capabilities are,

 1.System provides updates on the soil moisture, soil temperature, humidity, atmosphere
   temperature for every 30 minutes of period.

 2.User can monitor the current parameters or the trend of these parameters thorough the
   dashboard.

 3.User can turn on the motor at anytime from anywhere based on these parameters. The
   controls given in the dashboard are made it possible.

 4.We cannot expect the user to monitor the dashboard all the time and turn on the
   motor. Users, who do not often monitor the dashboard, can get alert messages when
   these parameters are exceeded above the user set threshold.

 5.Threshold levels can be set based on current parameters, trend of the parameters and
   the crop, which is being cultivated. Based on the alert message user can decide on
   whether to turn on the motor or not.

 6.An inexperienced farmer can take watering decision based on above parameters.
